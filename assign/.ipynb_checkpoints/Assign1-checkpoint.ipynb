    "     While studying MPS in Data Science I did a project for Introduction to Natural Language Processing titled “Sentiment Analysis and Match Prediction of India Vs Pakistan for T20 World Cup 2022: Pre-Match Review by India Today”. For this project I scraped the content from the news article “India Today” which consists of pre-match reviews and previous track records of two cricket giants India and Pakistan. My aim for the project was to apply natural language processing techniques to analyze and predict the sentiments from those pre-match review between these two teams which was based on their prior matches in the tournament as well as their past meetups."

    "     Though the project was successful in predicting the winner and calculation the sentiment for the game, the professor suggestion was that the dataset itself was not enough to make the prediction more accurate. The use of only one article for the analysis might have created a biasness from the author’s end. For more accurate and successful prediction I should have combined various other articles so that there is no biasness in the sentiment analysis and match prediction. "
